### Desrcription: 
                The task involves the calculation of the following structural descriptors of complex networks:
                
                a) Number of nodes
                b) Number of edges
                c) Minimum, maximum and average degree
                d) Average clustering coefficient (average of the clustering coefficients of each node)
                e) Assortativity
                f) Average path length (average distance between all pairs of nodes)
                g) Diameter (maximum distance between nodes in the network)

                NOTE: The descriptors should be extracted from the networks of the three categories:
                toy (sample networks), model (networks generated from models), and real (real networks).
